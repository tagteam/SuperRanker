abstract = {A reliable and precise classification of tumors is essential for successful diagnosis and treatment of cancer. cDNA microarrays and high-density oligonucleotide chips are novel biotechnologies increasingly used in cancer research. By allowing the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously, microarray experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the molecular variations among tumors and hence to a finer and more informative classification. The ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classification. This article compares the performance of different discrimination methods for the classification of tumors based on gene expression data. The methods include nearest-neighbor classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees. Recent machine learning approaches, such as bagging and boosting, are also considere...},

abstract = {Motivated by several applications, we introduce various distance measures between "top k lists." Some of these distance measures are metrics, while others are not. For each of these latter distance measures, we show that they are "almost" a metric in the following two seemingly unrelated aspects:(i) they satisfy a relaxed version of the polygonal (hence, triangle) inequality, and(ii) there is a metric with positive constant multiples that bound our measure above and below.This is not a coincidence---we show that these two notions of almost being a metric are the same. Based on the second notion, we define two distance measures to be equivalent if they are bounded above and below by constant multiples of each other. We thereby identify a large and robust equivalence class of distance measures.Besides the applications to the task of identifying good notions of (dis)similarity between two top k lists, our results imply polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithms for the rank aggregation problem ...},

abstract ={Ranked gene lists are highly instable in the sense that similar measures of differential gene expression may yield very different rankings, and that a small change of the data set usually affects the obtained gene list considerably. Stability issues have long been under-considered in the literature, but they have grown to a hot topic in the last few years, perhaps as a consequence of the increasing skepticism on the reproducibility and clinical applicability of molecular research findings. In this article, we review existing approaches for the assessment of stability of ranked gene lists and the related problem of aggregation, give some practical recommendations, and warn against potential misuse of these methods. This overview is illustrated through an application to a recent leukemia data set using the freely available Bioconductor package GeneSelector.},

Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},
