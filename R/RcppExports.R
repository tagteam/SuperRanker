#' Compute the overlap between k ranked lists

#' @description Computes the overlap (number of items present in all k lists divided by the current rank) for each rank in the k lists
#' @param rankMat A matrix with k columns corresponding to the k ranked lists. Elements of each column are integers between 1 and the length of the lists
#' @return A vector of the same length as the rows in rankMat containing the overlap between the lists for each rank
